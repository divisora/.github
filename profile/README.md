## About

Divisora project is an attemt to build a secure and open source portal for users/administrators who want to access different security zones. Instead of relying on each protocol being secure, this project aims to minimize the security impact of opening access without loosing control by only exposing a portal through HTTPS / noVNC.

While other projects tend to make the same product, this version aims for administrative tasks. Security, tracing and limited access depending on the user are some of the end-goals.
